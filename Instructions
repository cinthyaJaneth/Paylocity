Steps to Run the Playwright .NET Project in Visual Studio's Test Explorer

Step 1: Open Your Playwright .NET Project in Visual Studio
Launch Visual Studio (e.g., Visual Studio 2022).
Go to File > Open > Project/Solution...
Navigate to the directory of your Playwright .NET project and open its .sln (solution) file.
If you cloned it from GitHub, ensure you've opened the correct .sln file that contains your test project.

Step 2: Ensure Playwright .NET NuGet Packages Are Installed
In the Solution Explorer (usually on the right side), right-click on your test project (not the solution) and select "Manage NuGet Packages...".
Go to the "Installed" tab and verify that you have:
Microsoft.Playwright
Microsoft.Playwright.NUnit (if using NUnit for testing) or Microsoft.Playwright.MSTest (if using MSTest)
Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk (often installed by default for test projects)
If any are missing, go to the "Browse" tab, search for them, and install them.

Step 3: Build Your Project
To ensure Visual Studio recognizes your tests, you need to build the project.
Go to Build > Build Solution (or press Ctrl+Shift+B).
This compiles your test code and makes the tests discoverable by the Test Explorer.

Step 4: Open the Test Explorer Window
Once the project is built, go to Test > Test Explorer.
The Test Explorer window will usually appear as a tab, often next to the Solution Explorer or Output window.
